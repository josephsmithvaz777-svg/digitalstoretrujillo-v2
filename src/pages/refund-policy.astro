                        As we sell digital products (software licenses, game

                        case-by-case basis. Once a product key or license has
                        been delivered and revealed, it cannot be returned or
                        refunded under normal circumstances.

                        you receive a faulty or invalid key, we will replace it or
                        issue a refund according to this policy.
